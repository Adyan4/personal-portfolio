Created a personal portfolio showcasing projects and skills using HTML and CSS for the frontend and utilized a  
micro web framework to build the backend using Flask. web.py is the web framework, which was built using flask.
The templates folder includes the main HTML file of the website. The static file includes all images, fonts,
CSS and SASS sytlesheets, and JavaScript animations.
